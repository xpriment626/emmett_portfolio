                <p>
                    I'm an independent smart contract researcher and developer
                    working on bringing smart contract solutions to businesses,
                    institutions, and other organisations in Metro Manila.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It's always been my dream to be at the cutting edge of
                    innovation and evolution, and my passion for this space goes
                    beyond coding. I have a great appreciation for the science
                    of blockchain technology and am in awe of its potential to
                    one day become a fully self-sustaining, "Infinite Machine".
                </p>
                <p>
                    I strive to bring the most value to anywhere I find myself
                    in. I have a diverse skillset that will only grow more
                    competent over time, and at only 21 the sky's the limit to
                    what I can do for YOU. Let's work together to make the
                    blockchain future a reality.
