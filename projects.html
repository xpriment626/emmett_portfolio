                            just a few clicks. It features respective filtering
                            categories for items in collection, items created,
                            all items available in the marketplace.

                            (instructions in readme).

                            everything should work fine.

                            is simple but I use it as an example of the impact
                            blockchain technologies can have on a third-world

                            the core features you'd expect from a typical
